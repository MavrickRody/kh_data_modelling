Three Steps of Data Models

Data modeling represent the structures as well as the relationships between data elements. 

Following are three different steps of the data model.

1. Conceptual Model
In this step, data requirements are defined in the structure of the model, which present the business 
concepts to the business stakeholders.

	
2. Logical Model
The logical model documents the structure of the data and prepares it to implement in the database. 
It can include all types of data that need to be captured by a business analyst.

	 	
3. Physical Model
Then the physical model organizes the data with the help of the database management system. 
A database administrator defines it in tables, accounts access, performance, and CRUD system.

Types of Data Models

Five Types of the Data Model:

Hierarchical Model:
The hierarchical model is the first DBMS model; it represents the data in a hierarchical tree structure. 
The data is sorted hierarchically, and the arrows are used to navigate through the stored data.

Relational Model:
The relational model represents the data in tables, and it is based on first-order predicate logic.

Network Database Model:
Network Database Model is similar to the Hierarchical Model. However, the Network database allows a 
record to have more than one parent while Hierarchical Model does not allow more than one parent.

Network Database does not require the parent to child relation, unlike the hierarchical model. 
It represents the data as a graph and the record type and allows one to many relationships.

Entity-Relationship Model:
Entity-Relationship Model is useful in developing a conceptual design for the database. 
This model is easy to design with an ER model constructed.

Object Model:
Object model uses the objects, classes, and inheritance to store the data. 
The object model is used for complex applications as well as in the file management system.

Data Modeling Techniques
Following are some techniques we can use to create a useful and result-driven data Model.

Know Your Business and What Is Required to Improve It

It would be best if you had a clear understanding of your business, what is its purpose, and how you can 
utilize data to grow your business. For data modeling to be useful, you must have a deep understanding of your organization. 
Only then you will be able to gather relevant data that match with your aim for your business. 
Therefore, get to know your business and what is required from it, and then you will gather the 
relevant data you can use to grow your business. 

Data Visualizations
After you know what data you need to gather for your business to grow, itâ€™s time to think about how to present it. 
A graphical visualization can make it easier to not only understand data but also gather data from multiple sources. 
You can represent the data more clearly when present in a visual context.
